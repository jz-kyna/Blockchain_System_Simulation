This is a group simulation course project I completed during my Master of Engineering program at Cornell University. The primary goal of the project was to construct a simulation model to capture the behaviors of transactions and miners of a virtual currency system. Sensitivity analysis would be performed by simluating the system with different parameters, the best scenario recommendation would be made accordingly. The whole project was written in Python.

The project was started in November 2018 and finished in December 2018. I created this repository to re-organize all the materials in June, 2019.

In this repository, I included:

1) Project_Description.pdf: A detailed description of the objective of the project;

2) Final_Report.pdf: The final report of the project;

3) classes_and_functions.py: basic classes and functions built for running the simulation

4) simulation_and_validation.ipynb: the result of simulating using the built classes and functions, and the code for ploting and evaluating the steady state data

5) Raw_Data.xlsx: collection of steady state data

6) Steady_State_Sensitivity_Analysis.xlsx: sensitivity analysis for final parameter recommendation
